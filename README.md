## About this Project: First Steps

I am beginning the first project from The Odin Project to utilize skills learned from previous lessons.  

I will update this markdown file with a brief introduction of the project after completion of the project, which can be found at https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes. The updated `md` file will be more of a self-reflection to review what I have learned at the end of the project.
