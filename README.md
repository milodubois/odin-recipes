# odin-recipes

## Project Overview

This is a simple project I started on 15-May-2022 following instructions from the *free* and *open source* learning community called **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)** to practice the foundations of web develompent.  

## Objective

The goal of this first project is to utilize skills learned from previous lessons and modules in the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course by creating proper directory structure, using basic HTML elements and tags, and properly commiting changes using Git by command line.   

You can learn more and read the project instructions at https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes.  

## Retrospective

Completing this project truly helped to reinforce the foundational lessons covering Git, command line basics, directories, and basic HTML. 

As I learn more from the lessons, I may revisit this project to add more elements and style.  

I am grateful for the people at **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)** and I really encourage anyone interested in learning web development to visit the community!
